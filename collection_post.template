<b>To clean up the comments but still inform the hugger and huggee, these comments will now be collected in a daily posting. Because like a hug a great idea can be shared with everyone.</b>

<h4>Statistics for {{yesterday}}</h4>

|||
|-|-|
|Total calls|{{total_calls}}|
|Successfully delivered hugs |{{successful_calls}}|
|Failed because daily limit exceeded|{{failed_daily_limit}}|
|Failed because too many simultaneous commands|{{failed_too_many_commands}}|

We just started collecting these statistics in a useful way. When we get two weeks worth of data the analysis will be a little more detailed.

<h4>About the Hug token</h4>

Everyone deserves a hug. ðŸ¤— 

Call the bot with either !HUG or !Hug or !hug in your comment and you will share a hug with the person you are responding to. I.e. you both get one hug token.

There is no requirement to call the bot at least once per day. If you ever got hugged (i.e. got at least one HUG token in your wallet) you may call the bot a second time.
The current call levels are:

|HUG in wallet|calls per day|
|-|-|
|0|1ðŸ¤—|
|1|2ðŸ¤—|
|10|3ðŸ¤—|
|100|4ðŸ¤—|
|500|5ðŸ¤—|

<center><b>There is no monetary value to the token. It is pure symbolic, as a hug should be.</b></center>

The requirement levels for further calls might be changed in the future depending on token distribution. At least one hug will always be free.

**The bot will ignore your call if you use more than 5 !commands in your comment.**
